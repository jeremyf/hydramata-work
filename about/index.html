<p>
  <a href="http://curate.nd.edu">CurateND</a> allows for the uploading five Work types: Article, Dataset, Document, Image, and Senior Thesis.
  Four of the five Work Types (not including Senior Thesis) have their metadata attributes defined in an <a href="https://ndlib.github.io/metadata_application_profile/templates/">application profile</a>.
  There is a lot of overlap regarding the metadata elements that are rendered.
</p>

<p>
  One of the goals of the Hydramata::Works project is to allow institutions to create arbitrary Work types that are somewhat arbitrarily comprised of well-defined metadata element predicates.
  These predicates can be defined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">various ontologies</a>.
  Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">Friend of a Friend</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">schema.org</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Predicates can be complex in nature. Consider a "name" predicate.
  It could be comprised of "given_name", "surname", and several other elements.

</p>

<p>
  The Hydramata::Works project is positioning to allow for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The dynamic creation of different work types</li>
  <li>Assigning suggested predicates to the work types</li>
  <li>And declaring a recommended presentation structure for the work types</li>
  <li>Expose defaults for predicate values within a work type context</li>
  <li>Expose validation for predicate values</li>
</ul>
